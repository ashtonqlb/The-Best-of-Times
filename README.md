### The Missing Setup Guide for Tale of Two Wastelands on SteamOS 3

From The Best of Times FAQ section on Linux support.
> We cannot provide support for Linux as we don't use it, therefore we cannot troubleshoot issues specific to it.

This guide is a replacement for the 'Setup', 'Mod Organizer 2' and 'Tale of Two Wastelands' portions of "The Best of Times" guide, written specifically for SteamOS 3 (Steam Deck, Legion Go S) handheld owners looking to enjoy the finest Tale of Two Wastelands experience man has yet to imagine.
